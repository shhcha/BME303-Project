## Simulations
### computational methods
- Read Old / Write New, unique per iter
- Functions sorted into respective files
- Controlled Variables sorted into sections for easy adjustments
- Optimization of findNearest function
- Tunable variabnles are not empiracle constants, but rather they are tuned to provide realistic simulation outcomes

### analysis of graphs
- both graphs have similar starts, but they diverge quite quickly
- Urban light population increases exponentially, would eventually plateau 
- Rural Light population also increases exponentially, but at a much slower rate
- Urban Moth Population Decreases very quickly
- Rural Moth Population decreases in a much more controlled manner, approaching asymptotically to ~250, where it would reach equilibrium with the lights
- All of these are regions where lights / moths exist, not necessarily individual moths, allowing for modeling of large-scale population trends and movement:
