## Simulations
### computational methods
- Read Old / Write New, unique per iter
- Functions sorted into respective files
- Controlled Variables sorted into sections for easy adjustments
- Optimization of findNearest function
- Tunable variabnles are not empiracle constants, but rather they are tuned to provide realistic simulation outcomes

### analysis of graphs
- Urban light population increases exponentially, would eventually plateau
