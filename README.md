# BME303-Project
Simulating Moths &amp; Lights in Python
Created for UT Austin, Dept. of Biomedical Engineering - BME303 - Introduction to Computing, Dr. Ernesto Lima

Checklist (what Lima did in his example):
- [ ] Seed random # generator (optional)
- [ ] Create the grid
- [ ] Make list to store simulation data over time
- [ ] Plot initial state of the grid
- [ ] Collect the counts of each class (light, moth, empty space, etc)
- [ ] Run simulations 100x
    - [ ] Update states (growth, death, movement)
    - [ ] Update positions
    - [ ] Update plot, collect counts (population data and such)
- [ ] Plot population dynamics over time
